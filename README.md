# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
## Overview
Examining 30+ years of employee data to find current employees at, or near, retirement age.
Then using the data to visualize the impact of the coming wave of retirements on Pewlett-Hackard.

## Results
Four key takeaways from this analysis:
* About 72,000 positions will need to be filled to replace retiring employees.
* Most vacancies will be Senior positions.
* There are enough current employees to promote from within.
* With thousands of retirees and only a few hundred mentorship-eligible employees per department, the mentorship program is viable.


## Summary
There are two important questions to answer for Pewlett-Hackard:
* **How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**
    * About 72,000 employees are expected to retire in the next three years.
    * _Retiring Employees by Title:_ <br>

  As evidenced by the above, most vacancies will be Senior positions, meaning the company
  must hire a number of candidates with experience in each role. Fortunately, 
  there is the option of promoting from within, which brings us to the next figure.<br></br>

    * _Remaining Employees (without retirees) by Title:_ <br>
  ![curr_emp_no_retirees](/Resources/Tables/curr_emp_no_retirees.png)

  These are the remaining employees after all retirees have left the company. There are 
  enough employees at each position to cover the bulk of the replacements by 
  promoting from within, then PH can replace those that were promoted with entry-level 
  hires.<br></br>
  Promotions will not fill every vacancy though, as some employees may not be qualified for 
  such roles yet, so outside hires will be necessary at each position.

* **Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**
  * _Mentorship-Eligible Current Employees by Department:_ <br>

  * _Retirees by Department:_ <br>
  ![retirees_by_dept](/Resources/Tables/retirees_by_dept.png)

  The short answer is yes, there are more than enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in each department
  to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. It would take but a small fraction of the thousands
  of retirees in each sector to be able to mentor the young, program-eligible employees, so the program is perfectly viable,
  and PH seems well-equipped to survive the coming "silver tsunami."
